# Abstract
This study evaluated 12 healthy subjects during
tasting of passion fruit juice equivalently sweetened with sucrose (9.4g/100g), sucralose
(0.01593g/100g), and aspartame (0.05477 g/100g). Signal was recorded from two sites in
gustatory cortex (C3 and C4). Artifactual data was disregarded and remaining one were Fourier
transformed and frequencies vector fed a three hidden layers (16, 16 and 64 neurons) deep
neural network (DNN). Results indicated that brain responses distinguish juice sweetened with
sucrose from those one sweetened with low-calorie sweeteners (sucrose and sucralose).
